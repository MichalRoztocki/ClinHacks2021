# ClinHacks2021
## Inspiration
Our inspiration for the project came from our analysis of the data, our personal experiences with making healthcare decisions during the pandemic, and our desire to make a difference in minimizing the challenges of decision making regarding state restrictions.

## What it does
Our app provides a visual perspective on current state restriction levels and restriction levels that will minimize new COVID-19 cases and minimize the impact on elective surgery.
 
## How we built it
Our team analyzed the existing data sets and used that analysis to find a "sweet spot" in the balance between minimizing new COVID-19 cases and minimizing the impact on elective surgery.  We used a web application built using HTML, CSS, JS to display the restriction levels.

## Challenges we ran into 
One of our teammates left our group. For our next go around as a group we have to have more communication. Communicating is paramount when building anything.  Even though this was a minor speed bump we pulled through and came out with a win.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We created an application in 1 1/2 days.  For some team members this was a first hackathon and it was a great learning experience.

## What we learned
We learned a lot about how to work together, communicate, and divide up work based on individual strengths.

## What's next for COVID-19 State Restrictions Advisor
Due to time constraints our app currently only includes data for Alabama so we would like to include data for all 50 states. Ideally we would like to include a way for our app to reflect the most current data by scraping data quarterly.  We would also like to explore opportunities to make our code more efficient.
